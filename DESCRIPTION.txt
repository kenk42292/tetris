DESCRIPTION tetrisV8:

Tetris Battle Level: ~95

Separate threads for hand and main: hand and Brain parallel
Brain's task separated 4 times into 'SubBrain' threads
Full simulation of dropped pieces, including deletion of row
    --> resulting in simpler evaluation function
Complete piece-move association, all usable pieces grouped as array in enum
    --> no need to generate moves
Can predict future moves: However, due to no threading between brain and hand
    yet, it seems only looking 0 or 1 steps ahead is optimal
Two separate hands - one with max speed, other with less speed, but ability to move,
    then rotate
Strategy implemented
